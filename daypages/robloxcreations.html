            <h2>—— ROBLOX CREATIONS ——</h2>
            <p> I've been interested in making games for a good chunk of my life at this point.
              Quarantine enabled me to work on these little projects, but I couldn't seem to actually finish them.
              So here they are, basically a graveyard of unfinished games and unrealized ideas.
              It's honestly kinda sad to look at. But maybe one day I'll get to fully realize one of these.
              <br><br>
              There are definitely way more games than these, with sizeable place visits, but I'm frankly too embarassed to show them.
              They're silly. So the ones below are a list of what I'm confident enough to show off, basically.

            <h2> Hamon </h2>
            <p>
            Apparently my biggest game on Roblox. How did this reach 4500+ visits???
            <br><br>
            "Hamon" is a power in JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. I was trying to make a fighting game of my own with this idea.
            Obviously it sucks, but you can fight using the keys: E (hold), R, T, F, and Z. Each attack has a cooldown.
            The first time you use an ability, it doesn't load the animation for some reason. So try it again to see the animation.

            <h2> Graveyard </h2>
            <p>
            This was supposed to be a lobby of some sort for the next game: Limbo.
            Inspired by Ultrakill 7-1's starting area.
            I didn't get to work on a functioning lobby, so now it's just a game that leads you to the actual Limbo game.
            Keep walking forward, you'll see a portal.

            <p>
            Probably the most fleshed-out game here, yet it's still very unfinished.
            <br><br>
            This was supposed to be a puzzle-slash-obby game with a story. The aesthetics and ideas came from Ultrakill's Limbo Layer.
            The writing is kinda embarassing. At some point I just gave up and forgot about it.

            <p>
            A small little library to relax in and maybe write something.
            <br><br>
            This was supposed to be a library where you can write books and put them in the shelves to save them there forever.
            It didn't happen though, and I forgot about this little project right after making the environment.
            It would have been such a cool concept, leaving your own little book here where it will always stay.

            This one was pretty ambitious.
            <br><br>
            I wanted it to be a surreal hang out place where you can look at some weird sculptures.
            Interacting with these sculptures would take you to strange dimensions/worlds of their own.
            As of now, there's no sculptures (I gave up on Blender) and most paintings are blank.

            <br><br>
            There's nothing much to do but look at the shooting stars above and talk to the guy by the campfire.
            You were supposed to be able to wander the forest and find ooh mystical magical secrets oooh.
