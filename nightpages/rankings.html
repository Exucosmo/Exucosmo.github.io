        My personal, subjective top 5 tier list of mobile suits from 'Mobile Suit Gundam: Witch From Mercury.'
        <br>
        Images are from the Gundam Wiki. By the way, making these images was a pain, I had to keep resizing until it looked right.
        To be honest, the pictures I got doesn't do them justice. Search them up yourself if you're interested.

            <h2>—— Pharact ——</h2>
            <p>
            I would honestly rank both Pharact and Michaelis 5th place if I didn't like knightly aesthetic slightly more.
            <br><br>
            The long-range gun thing is awesome in action, and the face of this one is menacing.
            It's body looks like somewhat of an insect, and the feet are interesting.
            The purple color scheme is something I want to see more of.

            <p> 
            White and purple is such a good color scheme.
            I really like the knight-like aesthetic of Grassley's Mobile Suits.
            <br><br>
            It doesn't show it in the picture, but it has a large javelin
            that it uses as a melee and ranged weapon, further driving home the knight theme.
            The star shaped eye is a nice touch.

            <p>
            The amount of red here would make Char jealous.
            I LOVE weapons with long handles so this scratches that itch. The shoulder shields can even detach. 
            <br><br>
            When I saw Dilanza, I was like "I wish it was slimmer", and apparently they thought the same thing.
            It takes qualities from the Dilanza and incorporates it into a slimmer, more mobile (xd) Mobile Suit.

            <h2>—— Schwarzette ——</h2>
            <p>
            I'm a sucker for monochrome color schemes, and the bright pink Shell Unit accents go so hard.
            It has very clear characteristics from both Jeturk Mobile Suits and Gundam style.
            <br><br>
            The halo V-Fin is so fire.
            It has a large GUN that can also turn into a SWORD.
            Not to mention the wings can detach and form unique designs, like the iconic <a href="/rankingimages/Marionette.png" target="_blank" style="color: blueviolet;text-decoration: underline;">Marionette</a> form.

            <h2>—— Aerial + Rebuild ——</h2>
            <p>
            The "main Gundam" color scheme is executed SO well here.
            The bright and lively colors sometimes contrasts with its terrifying arsenal in a good way.
            I also appreciate the more curvier "feminine" shape and design which is rare in Mobile Suits.
            <br><br>
            I would rank Aerial Rebuild the same, and I really like the shift in tone to a more "militaristic" offensive version.

            <p>
            The sealed monster of Vanadis.
            It's actually amazing how well they were able to convey the "prototypical monster" idea.
            The red goes so nicely with the monochrome color scheme. It really looks like a Vanadis prototype gone rogue.
            <br><br>
            Not to mention THE BROOM. A BROOM RIFLE THAT IS ALSO ITS WAY OF TRANSPORT.
            This truly is the Witch (from Mercury).</p>

        <h2>—— Top 5 'JoJo's Bizarre Adventure' Stands ——</h2>
        <p style="padding: 10px;"> 
        My personal, subjective top 5 tier list of stands from the popular series 'JoJo's Bizarre Adventure'
        <br>
        Images are from the JoJo Wiki. JoJo's has a HUGE collection of stand abilities, so this ranking is as flimsy as a piece of paper.
        This is my favourite ones AT THE MOMENT, and could honestly change the next day.
        Seeing them in action looks even cooler, so search them up if you're interested.

            <h2>—— D4C ——</h2>
            <p>
            Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap (D4C) is a very unique design. And I always appreciate bunny ears.
            <br><br>
            The ability of this stand literally introduces pararrel universes in JoJo, and it's used very creatively.
            I would rank D4C and Wonder of U the same if Wonder of U weren't drippier.

            <p> 
            The drip is SO GOOD. I LOVE the black and yellow palette.
            <br><br>
            Wonder of U is very unique in that the design is very reminiscent of human clothing.
            Keep in mind, I haven't finished reading JoJolion so I can't say much about it, but it's ability is terrifying.
            Literally causing misfortune and calamity.

            <p>
            I rank them both the same. I love their two-color palletes.
            <br><br>
            Their contrast in ability (to fix and to destroy) is very interesting.
            Not to mention Killer Queen looks very naked but Crazy Diamond looks armored.
            These two also have a special place for me because Part 4 might be my favourite part.

            <p>
            Starting with regular Chariot, I LOVE the robotic knight aesthetic. I also like how it fights with a sword.
            <br><br>
            To Chariot Requiem, hands down the most mysterious-looking Stand ever.
            Such unnatural texture. Plus the weird yet terrifying abilities.
            The arrow is a nice complement to its design.

            The iconic time-stoppers. Possibly the most popular and physically strongest Stands in the entire show.
            <br><br>
            It's not really an ability contrast like the other protagonist-antagonist pairings,
            but the designs are definitely contrasting. Purple vs Yellow. Psst, hover over the image.

            <p>
            The ultimate ability contrast. Cause vs Effect.
            Not only are these my favourite designs in the show, they also happen to be terrifying in a cosmic kind of way.
            <br><br>
            Yellow-Purple and Red-White color palettes?? They're both so cool, and they have creepy eyes.
            It's not here, but I would rank Made in Heaven the same too.
